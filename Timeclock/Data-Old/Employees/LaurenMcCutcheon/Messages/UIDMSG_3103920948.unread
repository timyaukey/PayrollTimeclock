  <body>Hi Lauren,  I was wondering if we could set up a place to file Peoria orders.  I would like to reference your Thursday orders so I could more accurately judge how quickly plants are moving out.  This would help me with my Sunday orders.  Thanks!  -Kim  P.S. Hope you are having a lovely day!</body>
