  <body>What do you two think of the posters on the meeting table? All of the wholesale info is in the grey envelope. I told Leslie, the vendor, that I would give her our decision next Tuesday, 02/12. I personally like them and they are affordable wholesale and reasonably priced retail. We would need to spend a minimum of $100. Let me know what you guys think and what your favorite posters are, how many each you think would be reasonable to buy if we want to buy them, etc.</body>
