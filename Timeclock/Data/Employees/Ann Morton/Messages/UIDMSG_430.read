  <body>Sorry the store is kind of a mess! Things got pretty hectic in the afternoon. There's a pretty good chance we may get animal supply in tomorrow! I called and our rep seemed pretty confident that they could fill our order despite such late notice. There is a application in your box, Ann, she seemed cool and can be scheduled for an interview on friday anytime after 10am if you can give her a call tomorrow and pencil her in.</body>
