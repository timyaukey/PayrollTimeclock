  <body>Hi Susan, just a quick issue I wanted to discuss about the bird seed bags. The 40lb bags rip easily and the rips also spread easily because of the type of plastic bagging the supplier uses. I am not sure much can be done about this, but if it is possible it is something you might want to discuss with the supplier.
Thanks for your time!
