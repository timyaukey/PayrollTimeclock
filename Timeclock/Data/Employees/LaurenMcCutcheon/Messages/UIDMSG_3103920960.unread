Hey everyone, please email me back with an estimate or guess of the hours you want in the spring.

Thank you :)

Hey everyone!

I was wanting to gauge what hours everyone was wanting in the spring.  The schedule will probably not be the same all spring term, but instead, fluctuate around how busy the store the store is and when people are needed.

I will be giving out availability sheets later!

Thanks everyone :D
